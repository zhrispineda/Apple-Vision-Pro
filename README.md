#  Apple Vision Pro App
A SwiftUI mockup of Apple's app for Apple Store employees to monitor and control a demo unit of Apple Vision Pro on iPad mini (6th generation). The app was based off of this [post](https://x.com/AnandValavalkar/status/1754211501538185536). Since the app is mainly used on iPad mini, it has only been designed for iPad mini (6th generation).

With a sidebar full of quick navigation for demo resources, and a main panel mostly taken up by a video feed, with controls below it that affect the demo unit.](Assets/Preview.png)
